# Description
This is a web application to train John Conway's doomsday algorithm that allows you to predict the day of the week for any given date using the Gregorian Calender. 

# How to Use ?
Visit [application]() and enter computed date as indexed integer 0-6 
eg. SUN=0, MON=1, ... SAT=6

This application will track your success/fail ratio. How many can you get in a row?

# Learning the Doomsday Algorithm
Although this may appear confusing at first, it is actually quite easy to pickup after a few hours of practice.
